# Interactive 3D Gallery Viewer

A modular touchscreen-friendly system for interacting with 3D artworks.

This project provides a lightweight, installation-ready viewer for gallery environments. Users can rotate a sculpture, drag accessories onto it, and explore multiple configurations — all running locally in a browser using Three.js.

The system is asset-driven, config-driven, and designed to be reused for different artworks and exhibitions.

## Features

### Touch-Friendly Interaction
- One-finger rotate/orbit
- Two-finger gestures for rotation/removal
- Drag items from a tray
- Accessories snap cleanly onto predefined attachment points

### Stackable Accessories
- Accessories can attach:
  - To the main sculpture
  - Or to other accessories
- The system handles stacking rules automatically — no special coding per object.

### Asset-Driven
- Each object (base or accessory) is a self-contained GLB file.
- Each object may define its own attachment points (“sockets”) inside the GLB.
- No special naming conventions beyond simple node identifiers.

### Config-Driven

Everything about an object lives in a small JSON entry:
- Model path
- Preview image
- Optional attachment points
- Optional placement restrictions
- Optional size/scale information
Nothing hardcoded in JavaScript — swapping in new artworks or accessories is as simple as editing the config and dropping in new GLB files.

# How to Add New Artworks

1. Create a folder for the object under `/assets/objects/<name>/`
2. Export a `.glb` with:
   - Clean transforms
   - Embedded textures
   - Optional empty nodes used as attachment points
3. Add an entry to `config.json` specifying:
   - Model path
   - Preview image for the tray
   - Whether it has attachment points
4. That’s it — no code changes required.

*This design allows an installation team to bring in new sculptures, masks, ornaments, tools, etc., without touching the engine.*

## Installation Use
- Works offline
- Runs smoothly on gallery-sized 55–65” capacitive touch displays
- Small hardware footprint (mini-PC or similar)
- Designed for long-duration stability and easy reboot cycles
- Chrome in kiosk mode recommended

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Build for deployment:
```
npm run build
```

Serve locally:
```
npx serve dist
```
# Asset Guidelines

- Use lowercase folder + file names (e.g., `dog.glb`, `mask_bunny.glb`)
- GLB with embedded textures preferred
- Keep polygon counts modest for smooth touch interaction
- Models should face +Z and be upright
- Include a preview image for the accessory tray

# Developer Notes

## Code style
- Any JavaScript file we touch should stay JSDoc compliant.
- Add a short descriptive header comment at the very top of each touched `.js` file (e.g. `/** @file Brief description of what this file does. */`).
